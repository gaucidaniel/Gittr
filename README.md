Gittr is a Github feed viewer built to demonstrate an Android app following an MVP architecture, while at the same time implementing the [Material Design Guidelines](https://www.google.com/design/spec/).
It pulls public events from the Github Events API, with the ability to search for a specific user feed and filter the type of events that are received.

The following dependencies are crucial to the deveolpment of this project:

* RxJava2 for composing observables
* Dagger for dependency injection
* Retrofit for network calls
* ButterKnife for view binding
