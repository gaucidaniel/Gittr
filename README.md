Gittr is a Github feed viewer built to demonstrate an Android app following an MVP architecture, while at the same time implementing the [Material Design Guidelines](https://www.google.com/design/spec/).
It pulls public events from the Github Events API, with the ability to search for a specific user feed and filter the type of events that are received.

**[Install on Google Play (Alpha Testing)](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.danielgauci.gittr)**
